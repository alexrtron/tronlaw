                                            <h1>EXPERIENCED, AGGRESSIVE AND EFFECTIVE PERSONAL INJURY LAWYERS SERVING VENTURA COUNTY AND ALL OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA</h1>
<br />
                                            <p>Suffering an injury that is caused by someone else gives you certain legal rights. The person who caused your injuries may be held responsible for your losses, which may include past and future medical expenses, past and future lost wages or income, physical pain and suffering, and emotional distress.</p>
                                            <p>Tron &amp; Tron knows that an early investigation of the accident and talking with witnesses is crucial to your case. We will also want you to be sure and get the treatment or surgical care you may need, and we will help you deal with your healthcare providers regarding payment for your treatment, if you do not have insurance. We know how to help you through the process.</p>
                                <h1>We have extensive experience in all types of personal injury cases, including the following:</h1>
<ul>
    <li>
    Wrongful Death</li>
    <li>Serious Personal Injury&nbsp;</li>
    <li>Automobile / Motorcycle Accidents</li>
    <li>Bicycle Accidents</li>
    <li>Premises Liability (Slip and Falls) </li>
</ul>

                                </br> <p>Tron &amp; Tron has the resources and breadth of experience you expect from a large law practice but with the personal attention you deserve from a small firm. We carefully select the cases we handle so that we can devote all our energy and attention to getting you full and fair compensation. We each have over two decades of experience in handling all aspects of litigation, including discovery, depositions and expert witnesses. We are also prepared to take your case to trial, something which not all attorneys prefer to do. Our expertise and dedication has achieved great results for our clients.</p>

<p>We will take your case on a contingency basis, so you do not pay any fees unless you recover compensation for your losses. &nbsp;<br />
                                </p>
                                <p>Here are a few of the recent results we have obtained for our clients:</p><ul>
