												<h3>EMPLOYMENT LAW / WRONGFUL TERMINATION LAWYERS YOU CAN TRUST</h3>
<br />
<h3>EXPERIENCED ATTORNEYS SERVING VENTURA COUNTY AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA</h3>

<p>Losing your job is a devastating event.&nbsp; If you have been unlawfully terminated, we want to help you pursue all possible remedies. Suffering discrimination, harassment or retaliation is not right either, and we are here to help.&nbsp; You may be entitled to such compensation as past and future lost income, medical expenses, emotional distress damages and in some cases attorneys' fees. &nbsp;
<br />    
At Tron &amp; Tron, our attorneys have aggressively fought for the rights of people in Ventura County and throughout California for more than twenty-five years.&nbsp; We want to help you maximize your recovery, and we have the expertise necessary to achieve results.&nbsp; We have large law firm experience, but as a small law firm, we can carefully select the cases we handle so that we can dedicate all our energy, effort and attention to the details of your case. We take a team approach, working collaboratively to identify and resolve all your legal issues. We know how to get the results you want. We will be at your side throughout the legal process, from the initial evaluation of your claim through negotiated settlement or trial.</p>
<br />
We focus our employment law practice on the needs of employees, handling all types of cases, such as:<br />
<br />
                                <h1><b>Wrongful termination</b><br /></h1>
We protect the rights of people who have been discharged or fired in breach of an express or implied employment contract or in violation of law or public policy.<br />
<br />
<b>Discrimination</b><br />
We represent individuals who have been treated differently because of race, gender, age, disability, national origin, religion or sexual preference.<br />
<br />
<b>Sexual harassment</b><br />
We advocate for people who have been offered a job related benefit in exchange for sexual favors, who have been threatened with or subjected to mistreatment because of refusal to provide sexual favors, or those who suffer from a hostile work environment.<br />
<br />
<h4>Retaliation</h4><br />
We fight for the rights of people who have rightfully reported the unethical or illegal conduct of their employer or co-employees, only to face retaliation.<br />
<b><br />
Defamation</b><br />
We represent individuals who have suffered injury to their reputation from untrue statements made by their employer, typically after the termination of employment.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
We will take your case on a contingency basis, so you do not pay any fees unless we get you compensation for your losses. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Here are a few of the recent results we have obtained for our clients:
<ul>
    <li>Judgment against County of Ventura (co-counsel) &#8211; over $1,700,000</li>
    <li>Settlement with national car rental company&nbsp; -- $850,000</li>
